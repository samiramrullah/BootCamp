# BootCamp
This is for leaning git commands in bootcamp


# Day 1
 * DevOps
 * Github Actions
 * CI/CD piplines

# Day 2
# Software Testing
  ## Agenda
  - Introduction to Software Teting
  - Software Failure
  - Importance of Software Testing
  - Software Testing Life Cycle
  - SDLC vs STLC
  - Testing Softwares



  # SDLC
  1. Project Planning
  2. Requirement Plannning
  3. Design Plan
  4. Coding Plan
  5. Uinit & Integration Testing
  6. Software Testing
  7. Final Acceptance Testing


  # STLC
  1. Test Plan
  2. Test Requirements
  3. Test Cases Design
  4. Test Environment (how many test cases passed and failed)
  5. Test Executation
  6. Test Defect logs
  7. Test Reports

  * Purpose of Testing
    - Validate and varify sofware functions

# Test Goals
 * No Critical defects
 * Smooth Naviagational flow
 * Ensure flawless application

 # Types Of Testing
  1. Functional testing
  2. Non Functional Testing
     - Load Testing
     - Performance Testing
     - Stress Testing  (it should run continuously with time)
 3. Regression Testing --- Testing Preform after each test cycles <br>
    After every bug/error fixing we do regression testing -- it ensure if this bug fix has effected or caused another bugs



 ## Test Cycle Planned
 * Test Rounds - Functional Testing <br>
  Round for defect fixing

* Round for non functional testing <br>
  Test Rounds for regression testing


# Test Strategy  
1. Basic function Test
2. Wide function Test
3. Regression Test <br>
 we need to derrive 3 types of test cases



# Test Environment
- Windows laptop OS version 11 on 64 bit hardware

## Entry Creteria
- All test cases to be ready before start of testing
- All test environment must be ready before testing
- All Requirements test hardware to make before start of testing

## Exit Criteria
- If all entry criteria not met
- If critical defects cross more than **3**


## Defect Types
- Level A - Critical Defect
- Level B - Medium Defect or major or high
- Level C - major defect

# Test Risk Management
  - Update as and when reqired


# Test Progress Monitoring
 - Daily Meeting
 - Weekly Meeting
 - Monthly Meeting

# Test Metrics
  * Critical Defect found Rate 
  * Tester Defect found Rate
  * Test Cases pass Rate
  * Test Cases Fail Rate


# KATA Exercise
* Kata 1: Sanity First
* Kata 2: testing the happy path
* Kata 3: Be Negative     **-->** Test With invalid group of test inputs
* Kata 4: Setting Boundries  --> Determines invalid and valid test cases at boundries
* Kata 5: Working with Data --> we put put 100-500 username password and test (with automation testing tools)
* Kata 6: Are you authorized?
* Kata 7: Mocking Me

# SOFTWARE TESTING 

# Types of software testing
   1. **Acceptance testing**: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.
   2. **Integration testing**: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.
   3. **Unit testing**: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.
   4. **Functional testing**: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.
   5. **Performance testing**: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.
   6. **Regression testing**: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.
   7. **Stress testing**: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.
   8. **Usability testing**: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.


# Testing Metrics   
 - A metric expresses the degree to which a system, system component, or process possesses a certain attribute in numerical terms

 ## Types of Software Testing Metrics
 1. **Process Metrics**: A project’s characteristics and execution are defined by  process metrics. These features are critical to the SDLC process’s improvement and maintenance (Software Development Life Cycle).

 2. **Product Metrics**: A product’s size, design, performance, quality, and complexity are defined by product metrics. Developers can improve the quality of their software development by utilizing these features.

 3. **Project Metrics**: Project Metrics are used to assess a project’s overall quality. It is used to estimate a project’s resources and deliverables, as well as to determine costs, productivity, and flaws.
