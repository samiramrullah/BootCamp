# BootCamp
This is for leaning git commands in bootcamp


# Day 1
 * DevOps
 * Github Actions
 * CI/CD piplines

# Day 2
# Software Testing
  ## Agenda
  - Introduction to Software Teting
  - Software Failure
  - Importance of Software Testing
  - Software Testing Life Cycle
  - SDLC vs STLC
  - Testing Softwares



  # SDLC
  1. Project Planning
  2. Requirement Plannning
  3. Design Plan
  4. Coding Plan
  5. Uinit & Integration Testing
  6. Software Testing
  7. Final Acceptance Testing


  # STLC
  1. Test Plan
  2. Test Requirements
  3. Test Cases Design
  4. Test Environment (how many test cases passed and failed)
  5. Test Executation
  6. Test Defect logs
  7. Test Reports

  * Purpose of Testing
    - Validate and varify sofware functions

# Test Goals
 * No Critical defects
 * Smooth Naviagational flow
 * Ensure flawless application

 # Types Of Testing
  1. Functional testing
  2. Non Functional Testing
     - Load Testing
     - Performance Testing
     - Stress Testing  (it should run continuously with time)
 3. Regression Testing --- Testing Preform after each test cycles <br>
    After every bug/error fixing we do regression testing -- it ensure if this bug fix has effected or caused another bugs



 ## Test Cycle Planned
 * Test Rounds - Functional Testing <br>
  Round for defect fixing

* Round for non functional testing <br>
  Test Rounds for regression testing


# Test Strategy  
1. Basic function Test
2. Wide function Test
3. Regression Test <br>
 we need to derrive 3 types of test cases
